Activities track the progress of a user related to readable or watchable resources such as light novel and graphic novel chapters, and anime episodes. Activities are immutable and store meta information such as when the activity started, when it ended, from where the progress started and where it stopped. An example of activities might be a user watching on Netflix the Episode N of the Anime XYZ from minute 5:47 to minute 15:32 on the 7th of July at 8:35 PM. In this specific case a Chrome extension might automatically create a new activity every minute until the user pauses the video or closes the tab. The information collected allows the service to let the user know when was the last "checkpoint" recorded, enabling the user to resume the episode at the correct time on a different platform (i.e. continue from where I left).

There is no limit to the number of activities a user might generate and some activities are automatically registered from Animeshon itself, for example when a user is reading a graph novel directly on our platform. Activities can also be repeated multiple times for the same range (e.g. if a user rewatches the same scene in an episode 5 times). Whenever an activity is created that marks the end of a resource, its parent tracker is updated to include it in the list of completed resource.
