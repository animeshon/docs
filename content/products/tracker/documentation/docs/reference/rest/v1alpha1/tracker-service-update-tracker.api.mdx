A tracker tracks the progress of one or more users related to releasable resources such as animes, graphic novels, light novels, and visual novels. It is important to notice that users cannot `watch` an anime from a technical perspective but rather they can watch one of its releases such as its pysical DVD copy or its broadcast on Funimation. Nevertheless, for a better user experience a releasable content is considered completed whenever a user watched, played, or read all of its "regular" episodes, chapters, or releases. This means that "recaps" and "specials" are ultimately ignored. Animes and novels are easier to track as they have a countable and defined amount of resources that can be consumed (episodes and chapters). Their progress is therefore automatically updated whenever a new user activity is generated. Visual novels and video games in general do not always have a clear progress and therefore must be updated manually by the user. A tracker accounts only for the overall progress on a releasable content, this means that it won't provide any information about rewatches. Additionally, trackers can be shared among multiple users thorough audiences, this is useful whenever a user is, for example, watching an anime together with a group of friends and wants to keep track of the progress separately from his/her own personal progress or from the progress on the same resource with another group of friends (i.e. audience). The progress of audience trackers affects the personal progress, that is whenever new resources are consumed by an audience the personal tracker of each member belonging to that audience will be updated automatically as well. This behavior makes sense as a group of people  watching the Episode N of the Anime XYZ also means that each member of the group also watched the episode and therefore their collective personal progress changed.
