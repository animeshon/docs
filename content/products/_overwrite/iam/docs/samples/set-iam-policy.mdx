# Assign IAM policies

This page describes how to programmatically grant access to an Identity and Access Management API resource.

## Roles

The list of roles that can be assigned to _Identity and Access Management API_ resources can be found in the [reference page](/iam/docs/reference/iam/roles) for IAM roles.

## IAM Members

The IAM members that can be assigned to an IAM policy binding can be one of the following:

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `user:12345567890` | Used to grant roles only to a specific user. |
| `serviceAccount:12345567890` | Used to grant roles only to a specific service account. |

:::warning

The role `allUsers` cannot be assigned to Identity and Access Management resource policies for security reasons.

:::

## Sample

The following code sample shows how to assign a service account IAM policy with the role `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`. This means that that the policy member will be allowed full control over the specified service account, including resource deletion and IAM policy updates.

Replace `[SERVICE-ACCOUNT]` with the resource name of the service account that the policy should be assigned to, e.g. `users/123/serviceAccounts/my-service-account`.

Replace `[MEMBER]` with the resource name of the member to be assigned to the policy binding, e.g. `user:12345567890`.

:::tip

Tip: do not forget to replace `CLIENT-ID` and `CLIENT-SECRET` with valid [IAM Service Account](/authentication/service-accounts) client credentials.

:::

:::caution

The `SetIamPolicy` method will always replace (overwrite) any previously defined policy.
