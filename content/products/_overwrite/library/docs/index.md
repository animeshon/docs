# Library documentation

The `Library` service is responsible for the management of system-managed and custom collections of resources also known as playlists.

## System Playlists

There are currently two playlists that are automatically created for all users and that cannot be modified or deleted by the user itself. Such playlists are the collection of resources liked by the user, the `Liked` playlist, and the collection of resources that has been marked for future consumption (e.g. _watchlist_ or _watch later_), the `Later` playlist.
