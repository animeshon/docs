# Assign IAM policies

This page describes how to programmatically grant access to a Library API resource.

## Roles

The list of roles that can be assigned to _Library API_ resources can be found in the [reference page](/library/docs/reference/iam/roles) for IAM roles.

## IAM Members

The IAM members that can be assigned to an IAM policy binding can be one of the following:

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `allUsers` | Used to grant roles to anyone, both authenticated and unauthenticated. |
| `user:12345567890` | Used to grant roles only to a specific user. |
| `serviceAccount:12345567890` | Used to grant roles only to a specific service account. |

## Sample

The following code sample shows how to assign a playlist IAM policy with the role `roles/library.viewer` assigned to `allUsers`. This means that any user, doesn't matter if authenticated or not, will be able to access the playlist.

Replace `[PLAYLIST]` with the resource name of the playlist that the policy should be assigned to, e.g. `users/123/playlists/456`.

:::tip

Tip: do not forget to replace `CLIENT-ID` and `CLIENT-SECRET` with valid [IAM Service Account](/authentication/service-accounts) client credentials.

:::

:::caution

The `SetIamPolicy` method will always replace (overwrite) any previously defined policy.
