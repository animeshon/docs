Animeshon has released today its first product codenamed **Ashen**. This product is built on top of _perceptual hashing_ technologies and can retrieve **anime and episode metadata information** from screenshots or video frames.

The service is already available at the public address [source.animeshon.com](https://source.animeshon.com/) and along with **Ashen** the official [Documentation](https://docs.animeshon.com/) and [Discourse](https://discuss.animeshon.com/) have also been released to the public.

There is still a long way until the entire [Animeshon Ecosystem](/docs/ecosystem/introduction) will be fully stable and generally available, but we would like to celebrate this small step toward a more **community- and developer-driven** Anime and Manga industry.
