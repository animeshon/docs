This page is work in progress.

## Overview

An overview on what service accounts are and what they are used for can be found in the official [Google Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) documentation.

## Tutorials

### Create a service account

The current recommended approach is to follow the tutorial on how to [create a service account with browser cookies](/iam/docs/quickstarts/create-service-account-with-cookie). A feature to create service accounts from the UI will be implemented in the Animeshon App soon.

### Grant permissions to a service account

The current recommended approach is to follow the tutorial on how to [assign IAM roles and permissions to service accounts](/iam/docs/samples/set-iam-policy). A feature to grant permissions to a service account from the UI will be implemented in the Animeshon App soon.
