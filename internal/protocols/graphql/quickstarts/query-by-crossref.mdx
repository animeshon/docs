# Search by Cross-reference

This page shows how to use extern IDs to query Animeshon's Knowledge Base and retrieve all linked entities. 
Searching by external cross-reference is useful when building applications or scripts already based on external provider's IDs.

## Sample

`kind` specifies the kind of the entity **in the external provider**.

`namespace` specifies which external provider the entity `id` belongs to.

Replace `[TRACKER-NAME]` with the external ID.

:::tip

In the following example, replace `[TRACKER-NAME]` with `239` to search for ANIDB's Anime 239
