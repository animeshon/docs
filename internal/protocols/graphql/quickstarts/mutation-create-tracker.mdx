# Create a Tracker

This page shows how to create a tracker using Animeshon's GraphQL gateway.

## Sample

Replace `[USER]` with the currently authenticated user in the `users/{id}` format.

Replace `[RESOURCE-NAME]` with a valid content in Animeshon's Knowledge Base.

:::tip

Try to use `animes/4287922344858850139` as `[RESOURCE-NAME]`

:::

The mutation will create a tracker for the provided `resource` for the user specified as `parent`.

The call returns the unique name of the newly created tracker as `users/{user-id}/trackers/{tracker-id}`. This resource name can later be used to update the tracker.

:::warning

The caller must be already authenticated.

:::

:::warning

Each call creates a new tracker.
