# Get Viewer Info

This page shows how to get meaningful information about the `Viewer`. The viewer is the authenticated user currently performing the request.

## Sample

Performing the following GraphQL query returns info about the user.

Among all self-explanatory fields, `defaults` is a special field containing very important resources created by the system by default at the SIgnUp.
For example, the name of `albums` where to upload **profile** and **banner** images or the `LIKED` and `LATER` playlists.


:::warning

The caller must be already authenticated.
