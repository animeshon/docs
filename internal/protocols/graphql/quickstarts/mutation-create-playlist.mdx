# Create a playlist

This page shows how to create a playlist using Animeshon's GraphQL gateway.

## Sample

Replace `[USER]` with the currently authenticated user in the `users/{id}` format.

The mutation will create a playlist with the provided `displayName` for the user specified as `parent`.

The call returns the unique name of the newly created playlist as `users/{user-id}/playlists/{playlist-id}`. This resource name can later be used to update the playlist.

:::warning

The caller must be already authenticated.

:::

:::warning

Each call creates a new playlist.
