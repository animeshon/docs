# Image annotations

This page shows how to get and interpret `Image` annotations. Image annotations are attributes attached to any image created in Animeshon's systems.
Those annotations are useful to determine whether to show or hide them to the user.

For example, if someone has the **safe search** enabled, images annotated `VERY_LIKELY` to be `adult` should not be shown.

## Sample

`annotations` edge can be queried to any `Image` in the datagraph.

Replace `[RESOURCE-NAME]` with a valid content in Animeshon's Knowledge Base.
