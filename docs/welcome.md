### Welcome to the official Animeshon Documentation
<Highlight color="#f42555">Designed by Japanese Multimedia Content's enthusiasts for Japanese Multimedia Content's enthusiasts.</Highlight>

<br />
<br />

This documentation will provide explainations, tutorials and examples to use and integrate the `foundation toolset` developed for the Japanese Multimedia Community.

The Japanese Multimedia Culture is charaterized by a deep link between contents and multmiedia support, but the consumption and consultation of the related information is not as easy as it should be to fully enjoy what this industry can offer us. Informations, guides, reflections and reviews are spread across the internet and enthusiast have often to spend hours in order to fully understand or consume the content they love.


The foundation toolset Animeshon plans to release aims consolidate the information spread across the internet and expose them thought a trasparent and simple integration layer.  

If you ever stepped on one of the following question and you coulnd't find the answer, you are in right place:

* I found this image / meme, which content is it?
* Are there other content of this franchise? Maybe on different multimedia support?
* Is this the correct order to consume this content?
* Where can I consume this content?
* Are there any similar content I may like?
* Should I consume some other particular content to fully enjoy the story?
* I love this Voice Acress/Actor, can I find all the content she/he appears in?
