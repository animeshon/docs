### Welcome to the official Animeshon Documentation
<Highlight color="#f42555">Animeshon, designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts.</Highlight>

<br />
<br />

This documentation will provide definitions, concepts, and tutorials of how to use and integrate the `foundation toolset` developed by Animeshon for the Japanese Multimedia Community.

<!-- The Japanese Multimedia Culture is characterized by a deep link between contents and multimedia support, but the consumption and reference of the related information are not as easy as it should be to fully enjoy what this industry can offer us. Information, guides, reflections, and reviews are disseminated across the internet and enthusiast have often to spend hours to fully understand or consume the content they love. -->

The foundation toolset Animeshon plans to release aims toward the consolidation of the information spread across the internet, ultimately exposing it through a transparent and simple integration layer.  

If you ever encountered one of the following questions and you couldn't find a complete and appropriate answer, then you are in the right place:

* I found this video/image/text, where does it come from?
* Are there other content of this franchise? Maybe on different multimedia support?
* Is this the correct order to read/watch this content?
* Where can I read/watch this content?
* Are there any similar content I may like?
* Should I consume some other particular content to fully enjoy the story?
* I love this voice actress/voice actor; can I find all the content she/he appears in?
