:::warning

Oracolo is still under development. At the moment only 1/3 of the search capability is avaliable throught [Ashen](/docs/ashen/introduction)

:::

Oracolo provides **Search capability** to Animeshon's [Ecosystem](/docs/ecosystem/introduction).

It allows users to perform advanced research about all information available in [Detabesu](/docs/detabesu/introduction). Oracolo exposes poverfull and complete REST API and GraphQL interfaces for third-party systems integration.

Oracolo supports **text**, **image** and **video** search query. Image and video search capabilities are powered by [Ashen](/docs/ashen/concepts#perceptual-hashing) and [Ashen Grey](...) and are therefore resilient to edit and curruprion of the original frame, page, panel or image.

:::note

Until the completion of [Ashen Grey](...) image reverse serach will be availabe only for the `Anime` contents.
