:::warning

Oracolo is still under development. At the current stage only two-third of its search capabilities are available through [Ashen](/docs/ashen/introduction) and the **Full-Text Search** which is accessible through [GraphQL](/docs/graphql/quickstarts).

:::

:::warning

The components of Oracolo are currently not federated and therefore must be accessed through different services, this will change in the future. Stay up-to-date by consulting our [Roadmap](/docs/oracolo/roadmap) for more information.

:::

Oracolo provides a large range of **search capabilities** to the Animeshon [Ecosystem](/docs/ecosystem/introduction).

It allows users to perform advanced searches about all resources available in [Detabesu](/docs/detabesu/introduction). Oracolo exposes powerful and complete REST APIs as well as GraphQL interfaces for third-party systems integration.

Oracolo supports **text**, **image** and **video** search queries. Image and video search capabilities are powered by [Ashen](/docs/ashen/introduction) and [Ashen Grey](/docs/ecosystem/roadmap) and are therefore resilient to minor edits and/or corruption of the original resource.
