## Welcome to Detabesu, the Graph-Knowledge Base
Detabesu is the first `Graph-Knowledge Base` easily expandable, integrable and consultable of the Japanese Multimedia Industry.

Detabesu proposes a new way of manage and take advantage of the available informations about the Japanese Multimedia Contents combining three concepts:

* Availability of information:  
Detabesu has been designed to contain information about all available *content* in all available **multimedia support**. [Community contribution](...) and [Third Party Dataset Import](...) are key milestones to ensure that Detabesu stay up-to-date with the industry and infinitely support new typology of content.

* Interconnection of the information:  
Detabesu main goal is to create links between different *content* on different **multimedia support**. Providing a thightly interconected dataset allows users and developer to explore new aspetects of the industry and discover new way to enjoy the content not as a standalone piece of art but as part of a bigger ecosystem.

* Query Answer Power:  
Detabesu is powered by a Graph Database. Graph Databases are known to be particularly suitable to manage higly interconnected data and offer powerfull Query language to *traverse* the **graph** with minimum effort. This structure allows users and developers to explore the connections between Anime, Manga, Light Novels, Visual Novels, Person, Companies, Geographycal Area, Date simply following the links between them.  <br /> <br />
E.G.:
Given an Anime, it's possible to get the related companies to the companies involved in the production of it's Visual Novel adaptation by simply following the ouotgoing links from the selected Anime.

<br />

Detabesu represent Animeshon's Mission core, offering a powerfull tool capable of accept, manage and answer very complex and tightly interconnected data structures.

Detabesu, along with it's [GraphQL](...) intefaces gives to the user and developer complete power about what data and how to retrieve information, creating the perfect fundation for a new ecosystem of application and platform.
