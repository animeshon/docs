## Welcome to Detabesu, the Graph-Knowledge Base
Detabesu is the first `Graph-Knowledge Base` easily expandable, integrable and consultable of Japanese Multimedia Content.

Detabesu's development state is shown in [Detabesu Roadmap](/docs/detabesu/roadmap).

Detabesu proposes a new way of manage and take advantage of the available informations about the Japanese Multimedia Indutry combining three concepts:

* **Availability of information**:  
Detabesu has been designed to contain information about all available *content* in all available **multimedia support**. [Community contribution](/docs/ecosystem/roadmap) and [Mass Import (Wormhole Pipeline)](/docs/ecosystem/roadmap) of `external datasources` are key milestones to ensure that Detabesu stays up-to-date with the industry and ensures the support of new content's typology.

* **Interconnection of the information**:  
Detabesu creates links between different *content* on different **multimedia support**. Providing a thightly interconected dataset allows users and developer to explore new aspects of the industry and discover new way to enjoy the content not as a standalone piece of art but as part of a bigger ecosystem.

* **Query Answer Power**:  
Detabesu is powered by a Graph Database. Graph Databases are known to be particularly suitable to manage higly interconnected data and offer powerfull query language to *traverse* the **graph** with minimum effort. This structure allows users and developers to explore the connections between Anime, Manga, Light Novels, Visual Novels, Person, Companies, Geographycal Area, Date simply following the links between them.  
:::note
E.G.:  
Given an Anime, it's possible to get the related companies to the companies involved in the production of it's Visual Novel adaptation by simply following the ouotgoing links from the selected Anime.
:::

Detabesu, along with it's [GraphQL](/docs/detabesu/graphql/quickstart) intefaces, gives to the user and developer complete power about what data and how to retrieve information, offering a powerfull tool capable of accept, manage and query very complex and tightly interconnected data structures.
