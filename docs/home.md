### Welcome to the official Animeshon Documentation
Designed by Japanese Multimedia Content's enthusiasts for Japanese Multimedia Content's enthusiasts.

<br />

In this documentation will be provided explainantion, tutorials and examples to use and integrate services and features aimed to help the Japanese Multimedia Community developing new *fantastic*, *smart* and *lovable* applications and/or platform.

The fundation toolset Animeshon plans to create and provide aims to answer some question that currently the Japanese Multimedia Ecosystem is not able to answer.

* I found this image / meme, which content is it?
* Are there other content of this franchise? Maybe on different multimedia support?
* Is this the correct order to consume this content?
* Where can I consume this content?
* Are there any similar content I may like?
* Should I consume some other particular content to fully enjoy the story?
* I love this Voice Acress/Actor, can I find all the content she/he appears in?

It is not rare to see questions like those around the internet, the Japanese Multimedia Culture is charaterized by a deep link between contents and multmiedia support, but the consumption and consultation of the related information is not as easy as it should be to fully enjoy what this industry can offer us. Informations, guides, 
reflections and reviews are spread across the internet and enthusiast have often to gold dig in order to fully understand or consume the content they love.
