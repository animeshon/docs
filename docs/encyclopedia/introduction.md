## Version
The current [version](/docs/developers/release-lifecycles) of the Encyclopedia is `Pre-GA`.

## Introduction
[Animeshon's Encyclopedia](https://animeshon.com) provides a visual interface to [Detabesu](/docs/detabesu/introduction), allowing non-developers to access, search and consume information about a huge variety of content.

The Encyclopedia offers a new navigation experience focused on the relation between different content media, resulting in an immersive user experience.

The tightly linked dataset combined with [Oracolo](/docs/oracolo/introduction) search capabilities, provides the Encyclopedia with the potential to reinvent the search, navigation and discovery of the Japanese Multimedia Content, providing as much information as possible, about as many types of content as possbile, in the easiest and clearest way as possible.

The current version of the Encyclopedia implements basic functionalities to showcase and test the power of the underlying [Detabesu](/docs/detabesu/introduction), but it is already planned to expand it with more **user-driven** feature and functionalities as described in the [Encyclopedia Roadmap](/docs/encyclopedia/roadmap).
